**Python Classes**
A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

class ClassName:

class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0


**Python Objects**
An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc from the class.

class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0
bike1 = Bike()
