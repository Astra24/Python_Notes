**function**
is a block of code that performs a specific task.

you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:
create a circle function

Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

**Types of function**

**Standard library functions**
These are built-in functions in Python that are available to use.
**User-defined functions** 
We can create our own functions based on our requirements.

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 + num2
    print('Sum: ',sum)

# function with no argument
def add_numbers():
